# Templates
Various templates I use for easily creating projects.

---

## Usage
```
templates.py -t <project> -d <directory> <type>
```
creates a `<type>` project named `<project>` in the directory `<directory>`.
Run `python templates.py -h` for more help.

### Installation
Run `bash install.sh` (`sudo` will be prompted as needed) and the script will be installed to your `PATH` so you can call `templates` anywhere in your terminal.
You might need to install the dependencies with [`pip install -r requirements.txt`](http://bit.ly/2wqf0gh).
